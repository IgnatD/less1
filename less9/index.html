    <div class="box">It is well-known fact that the Internet has become an essential part of our life and we will do nothing with it. I am sure that every person has Internet dependence whether hefinds necessary information orjustchats with other people. I am not exception.

            As for me, I usually use the Internet at home as a «box» full of different interesting facts and alsoas a way of communication. By means of the Internet, I can talk to people wherever I was. By the way, it is possible to self-educate easily, to read books, which are too expensive in the shops, make purchases, make online appointments with the doctor, to listen to music and others.</div>
